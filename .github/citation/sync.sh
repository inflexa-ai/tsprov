#   (no args)  rewrite CITATION.cff in place
#   --check    exit non-zero if it is out of step, changing nothing
#
# package.json is the single source of truth for the product version: its
# version field is what gates the npm publish and mints the v* tag and the
# GitHub release (.github/workflows/release.yml), so the citation metadata
# follows it rather than being maintained by hand.
#
# --check compares ONLY the version. date-released is written from the clock at
# sync time and would otherwise make the check fail every day after a release.
